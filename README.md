## Reflection

Writing the logic for the calculator was extremely rewarding yet difficult, as I continued to solve small bugs I ended up creating another bug. This process continued until I fixed all bugs. Going forward I definitely will focus on making my code more readable as I feel my current code is difficult to read.
